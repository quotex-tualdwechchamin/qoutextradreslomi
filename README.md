Quotex does not come under
[SEBI](\%22https://www.adigitalblogger.com/share-market/sebi/\%22 "\"SEBI\"")
because, as per the Quotex team, since it is based out of Sychelles and
not in India -- that is why it cannot be regulated by SEBI.

But that's not really a point, is it?

They could simply open an Indian office and work under the regulator.

However, they won't do that. For if they do so, they would need to take
care of all the compliances under [SEBI
guidelines](\%22https://www.adigitalblogger.com/demat-account/sebi-guidelines-for-demat-account/\%22 "\"SEBI"){guidelines"=""}.
All complaints that they recieve, which are pretty high in number by the
way, would need to be resovled in a stipulated period of time.

That would be challenging for a brand who is giving away 80% of its
revenue in sharing with its affiliate partners in India, at least.

## Can We Trade in Quotex in India?

Well, the simple answer to that is -- if you really don't care about
your hard-earned capital and are okay if there is no one to help you
when you are stuck with a vague platform such as Quotex, then the answer
is yes.

Why do we say so?

For the simple reason that if you are stuck with your capital in this
account then you will not be able to file a complaint at SEBI or RBI
against it.

These institutions will simply respond to you saying that the
corresponding platform has been banned by the banking regulator sometime
back and it is not legal to trade using Quotex.

There are [FEMA
regulations](\%22https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1869821/\%22 "\"FEMA"){regulations"=""}
(Foreign Exchange Management Act), 1999 that do not allow to trade in
foreign exchanges through electronic trading.

Thus, next time you see an ad or a fake-finfluencer promoting Quotex
directly or over Telegram, remember -- they are going to make 80% in
brokerage sharing and upto 7% of the overall turnover you create through
your trades.

Yes, that is what they will recieve if you trade on Quotex using their
referral link.

Hopefully, this piece was an eye opener for you to understand the
legalities and regulations around such a platform.
